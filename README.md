This is a portfolio project for the Codecademy Fullstack-Engineer Career Path.


## Scope:
#### Project-description by Codecademy:

For this project, I will build a quote generator program. Every time a user runs a program, they should get a new, randomized output. I can make the project in a couple of different forms, like an astrology generator, inspirational message, or nonsensical jokes. To make my program truly random, the message that it outputs should be made up of at least three different pieces of data. From what I know of JavaScript syntax so far I will build the program and customize it in my way.

### Project Objectives:
+ Build a message generator program using JavaScript
+ Use Git version control
+ Use command line
+ Develop locally on your computer
#### Prerequisites:
+ JavaScript
+ Git and GitHub
+ Command line
